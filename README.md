# Weather Console

This is an introductory project that I built using go. I wanted to build something that wouldn't take more than a couple of hours to get working.

## Goals

- Get JSON data from an API
- Read `.env` file and get configuration options for the API
- Create a terminal application

While building this project I found an awesome website for converting JSON data to a go struct.
